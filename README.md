•	How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure my software meets these requirements by following industry best practices, and writing and solid tests.  Making sure these tests have good coverage and are designed to effectively reveal flaws.

•	How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret users needs by putting myself in their shows.  I thoroughly read documentation and then implement the needs to the best of my ability.

I approach designing software by taking each task one step at a time.  Write the code for a requirement, tests it, and write the next one.
